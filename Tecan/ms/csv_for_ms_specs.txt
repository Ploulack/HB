"dipks_sample_1", #sample name, typed by the user in the UI

#Fields that generate the sample to force the user to enter the proper sample name format:
# list of fields: strain_optional.plasmid_optional.group

# The user then must tag a well as being either a blank, a standard, or an analyte  (Actually no, this will be done automatically)
#
# Will need a mongo collection to store all sample names
# A sample name must be unique under an experiment = experiment must be tied before hand to monitor sample uniqueness
# There's no naming of a sample when it's part of an experiment: the name is generated from
# - mutation site being tested,
# - well positioning: user enters range of wells used
